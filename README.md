### What to do
      While our project currently has basic functionality, the following features and improvements are planned for future releases:

    Test Automation: Extensive unit and integration testing will be added to make the application more stable and reliable. Testing of API endpoints will be performed using tools such as Jest and Supertest.

    CI/CD Integration: Tools such as GitHub Actions or Travis CI will be integrated for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes. This will enable code changes to be automatically tested and quickly put into production.

    Front End Development: It is planned to add a web or mobile interface to the project. A user-friendly interface can be developed using modern JavaScript libraries such as React, Angular or Vue.js.

    Advanced User Management: User management features will be expanded and user roles and authorizations will be managed in more detail.

    Performance Optimization: Database queries and API responses will be optimized to increase the performance of the application.

    Security Enhancements: Additional protection mechanisms against security threats such as XSS, CSRF and SQL Injection will be implemented.

    Expansion of Documentation: More detailed technical documentation and development guides will be prepared for developers who will contribute to the project.
    
    Improvements Based on User Feedback: The user experience and functionality of the application will be improved based on feedback from users and other stakeholders.
